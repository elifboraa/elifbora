    <h1>Emergence: A 3D Projection Mapping Project</h1>

    <p>This project explores the organic growth of both cities and nature, drawing parallels between the expansion of
        built environments with natural growth patterns. It raises questions such as, *Should cities be designed with
        rigid grids to ensure livability?* How do natural elements like water, forests, and topography influence human
        settlement and growth? And does organic urban development allow for a more harmonious coexistence with nature?
    </p>

    <p>In thisinteractive installation, viewers interact with the project by altering the topographical elements and
        moving their hands to observe a city growing between these natural forms. Through this transformation, viewers
        observe how nature and the city might intertwine, prompting reflection on how urban environments can grow in
        harmony with the natural world.
    </p>

    <h2>Proccess</h2>

    <h3>Ideation </h3>

    <p>We started out thinking about the relationship of cities with water, and how water affects the emergence of a
        city. We decided that we wanted to use a 3D topography model, so that we could project the water on the
        topographical surface & explore interactions with the user (via a webcam or mediapipe) simulating urban and
        natural elements (with particle systems or another way to create organic visuals), and terrains. We wanted the
        natural elements to be generated via more organic movement of the user (drawing, hand gestures and etc.), and
        the city to be generated with more mechanical movements like putting blocks of geometry onto the interaction
        zone. Similarly we also thought about the user being able to alter the topography by moving some parts of it
        around. We ideated how we could make these interactions work, and what the visuals outcomes would be.</p>

    <h3>Topography Model</h3>

    <p>We discussed that the model should be big and have a detialed. We also decided that the observer
        should be able to interact with it, such a changing the position of the hills and etc. Since we aimed to
        integrate
        debth detection to our model, we wanted to have a topography with varying depths of mountains. This project
        where a
        sandbox is used to generate different landforms was our insipiration point. We decided not to use a real
        location
        but a randomly generated terrain.</p>

    <p>To do this, I have used Blender A.N.T Landscape addon where a mesh with noise displacement can be generated and
        adjusted according to the level of desired details and scale. Then I turned this generated model into isometric
        lines and then exported it for laser cutting. After the laser cutting, we have gathered the parts and sticked
        them
        together. Our topography model was ready.</p>

    <h3>Depth Detection with Kinect</h3>

    <p> We firstly used Kinect V2 2.0 and the issue we faced was, it was good at representing a large distances of
        depths, but wasnt so good at giving a detialed view of
        small
        distances. Since the height difference in each level on our model was 3mm apart, we needed a more precise
        representation. We firstly switched from Kinect V2 to Kinect Azure, which gave us a better point cloud
        representation of the height differences in our previous model (where the heigth difference is 6mm between each
        level). However, we still needed a more precise output and we needed to exclude the object in the distance such
        as
        the surface and the floor. To be able to make this we used this tutorial to create a custom depth map via using
        GLSL. This allowed us to only have the point cloud of our model, excluding the surrounding objects.</p>

    <p>Although we had a good point cloud view of our model, we still needed to represent the height difference with a
        higher contrast in the output image. To do this, we increased the contrast between the maximum and minimum
        height
        difference. Finally we were able to get a clear debth image.</p>

    <h3>Organic Growth Interaction</h3>

    <p>For the organic growth, we used the previous method of using noise and edge detection to generate a growing city
        effect. This time, the organic growth represented the city, so we decided that the generation should happen in
        square grids. Also we decided to change the interaction into hand movement that will be tracked bu mediapipe.
        The hand is tracked to draw a line and from this line, an organic city generates. We explored that Kinect camera
        can
        be used for Mediapipe as well, so we did not need an extra webcam. For the renewal and the regeneration of the
        organic city growth, we used a timer that resets the canvas at every 30 second. We integrated a mask where the
        lowest
        and higest parts of the terrain is blocked, therfore the growth wouldnt happen at those points.</p>



    <h2>Technical Details</h2>


    <p> For the model, we used 20 A3 Greyboards of 3mm thickness. Used a laser cutter to cut each level of topography,
        and finally glued them together. </p>

    <p> We hung the Kinect Azure and a Logitech webcam (we realized we did not need this later, and we can use Kinect's
        camera for Mediapipe instead) from the ceiling, using steel zip clips. We used a leveling ruler to align the
        Kinect
        perfectly. BenQ W1070 Projector, to project onto the model. </p>

    <p> We used Blender for modelling, and Touchdesigner to create the interactions and the visuals. </p>
