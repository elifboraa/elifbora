    <h1> 🏃‍♀️‍➡️ Moon Runner: A 2D Infinite Runner Game Made in p5.js.</h1>

    <h2> Overview & Project Description</h2>

    <p>This project is an infinite runner game where the player has to avoid the obstacles and collect coins. The player
        needs to press up arrow to jump and "A" key to shoot. Player earns points just by progressing in the game,
        however they can collect extra points by collecting coins and shooting asteroids. This game allows the player to
        restart the game.</p>

    <p>To develop this game I have studied at several infinite runner games made in p5.js(link1, link2, link3) to
        understand how to utilize classes, objects and functions, as well as understanding the concept of object
        collissions. Throughout the project, I used conditionals, for-loops, arrays, noise, loaded images, functions, event handlers,
        and classes.</p>
