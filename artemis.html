        welding place, which she burned by mistake, several years ago. Because she and her father don't talk since the
        incident, she lives alone in a capsule house and has a job with low income. She earns extra money by bringing
        illegal goods into the city. the events start to emerge when Trond Landvick (one of the customers whom Jazz
        brings illegal goods to), asks Jazz a favor and offers her a lot of money. Her illegal mission is to sabotage
        Sanchez Aluminum Factory by destroying their harvesting machines which collect anortite in order to produce
        aluminum and provide oxygen to the city. Jazz is also good at welding. Throughout the game she will progress by
        running, jumping and welding.</p>
