    <h1 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">🌊🌊 Hidden Streams of Ankara Part II: 3D Infographic Video Project
    </h1>

    <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"> The project aims to demonstrate the facts about unplanned urbanization, triggering  flash floods, which causes
        severe economical loss, injuries and high levels of death. The city of Ankara is chosen for its history of poor
        urban planning. The city also lost its rivers, in order to create more space and infrastructure for the rapidly
        increasing population. Therefore the project also stresses  that rivers are essential for the regulation of
        water circulation in urban areas.

        The project includes 3 short videos, where in each video, a different subtopic is highlighted. In the videos,
        the data that represent the severity of floods and their outcomes, are presented through a variety of data
        visualization methods.

    <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">The data, aimed to be represented is collected, filtered and organized. Then, different methods and graphic
        styles that will represent the data accurately are explored. The information is classified into three parts and
        the scripts are formed accordingly. Afterwards, storyboards of the three videos are designed. The required
        visuals are created using Blender and Illustrator. Finally, using After Effects and  Adobe Premiere, final video
        was formed.</p>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Storyboards
    </h2>

    <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">The first video emphasizes the effect of unplanned urbanization and global warming on increased numbers of
        floods, globally. The second video, dwells on the floods in Turkey, and reveals the data related to it. The
        third video, presents the urbanization process of Ankara, and how its rivers were eliminated from the urban
        system. Its effect on floods happening currently, is emphasized. </p>

    <h2 style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Inspiration</h2>

    <p style="color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"> Water related structures built in the Early Republican Era were used as an inspiration for selecting the font
        and color palette.   These buildings are Su Süzgeci, Çubuk Bendi, and Çubuk Baraj Gazinosu. Currently these
        structures  are demolished, representing the destruction of the streams as the city expanded.</p>
