    <h1> 💘 Un-Cupid: Target Game Made In Unity</h1>
    <h2> Overview & Project Description</h2>

    <p>UnCupid is a Valentine's Day game for singles, where the players are playing the cupid-angel role, but with a
        twist. Instead of bringing the people together, the aim is to break them up, using a bow and arrow. The theme of
        the game is inspired by the people complaining about spending Valentine's day alone and envying the couples who
        don't (not a personal issue).

        I designed the console to function like a bow, allowing the players the sensation of streching and releasing a
        string. The same idea can be applied to slingshot games, where the players would use the console horizantally,
        instead of vertically. I used a strectch sensor for the console, which perfectly induces the feeling of using a
        real bow. Unlike a mouse or a joystick, a strech sensor, provides a more immersive and realistic experience of
        aiming and shooting.

        The game is a single-player experience, where the player is represented with a bow and arrow on the screen.
        Since I was limited to using only one sensor, I could only give the player the control over amount of strech and
        release. As a result, bow points to a fixed position. Since I wasn't able to make the bow rotatable, I made the
        targets mobile, moving in a looping motion from side to side.

        The game consists of four levels, with increasing difficulty in each stage. As the player progresses more
        targets appear along with obstacles that are preventing them getting shot. Targets are represented with farm
        animals with hearth shaped particles emerging from their heads The obstacles are depicted with roses,
        reinforcing the Valentine's Day theme. Due to the bow's lack of rotation and orientation control, the game
        functions as a 2D game, although the environment is designed in 3D.

    <h2>Process</h2>

    <h3>1. Ideation for the console design</h3>

    <p>II decided that I wanted to create a slingshot game using a literal slingshot as a console, so I started to
        research what type of sensors I could use for this. </p>

    <h3>2. Concept developement of the game theme and and mechanics</h3>

    <p> I was thinking about the game concept, and since the project was due Valentine's Day, I decided that the theme
        can be related to it. This made me realise that the player as a cupid, should use a bow and arrow instead of a
        slingshot, and the mechanics would still work the same, for such a game.
    </p>


    <h3>3. Initial game developement using mouse control</h3>

    <p>I needed to implement the game mechanics without the console first. So I developed a game that was playable via
        mouse control.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Testing serial data reading from strech sensor</h3>

    <p>This was my first time using a strech sensor so I learned how to create a circuit with a strech sensor and write
        a code to enable serial reading from it.

    </p>

    <h3>5. Integrating strech sensor into Unity</h3>

    <p>I have made a blank sketch and followed the tutorial in panopto to allow serial reading within Unity. However,
        this gave a timout error and through classmates, I learned that I needed to do something called multithreading.
        I used chatGPT to write the code for it.
    </p>

    <h3> 6. Adding serial read into the game mechanics</h3>

    <p>I replaced mouse control with the serial data from strech sensor.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Collection and implementation of game assets and UI</h3>

    <p>So far, I used very basic assets and UI elements, prioritising creating to a game that was working. Then I
        started spending time on the visual and audio elements of the game. I used free assets that I found from various
        resources online.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Adding More Levels</h3>

    <p>I wanted to add levels to my game, however, in this process the serial reading strated to give an error. I spent
        a lot of time debugging this issue.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Building the game console</h3>

    <p>I created a bow from cardboards that were upcycled from the parcel boxes I had been collecting. I inserted the
        strech sensors like a string of the bow, via holes. The connection of the sensor to arduino is provided by
        crocodile clips
    </p>

    <h3>10. Debugging and final refinements</h3>

    <p>The final touches on the game visuals, audio and mechanics are made and final debugging were done.
    </p>

    <h3>11. Publishing the game for web/ Publishing the game as an app</h3>

    <p>Since I wasn't able to publish the console controlled version of the game for the web, I published the mouse
        contolled version. I built the console controlled version as an app on my desktop.
    </p>

    <h3>12. Playtesting and gathering feedback for further developement</h3>

    <p>I asked friends and family to play the game and observed their reactions to further develope the game.
