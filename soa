    <h1>Hidden Streams of Ankara:
        Data Visualization Project
    </h1>

    <p>This is the first part of the data visualization project that aims to give information about the floods in
        Ankara. The streams that existed long before the urbanization of Ankara, have been directed into sewage pipes in
        order to provide more space for settlement and infrastructure. However this has limited the flow of the
        rainwater. Furthermore, unplanned urbanization effects the circulation of water, increasing the evaporation
        rate, thus the rainfall per minute. As a result, hazardous floods become more frequent each year in the
        city of Ankara.

        The project aims to create awareness by demonstrating the relevant facts and data through infographics and data
        visualization
    </p>

    <p>In thisinteractive installation, viewers interact with the project by altering the topographical elements and
        moving their hands to observe a city growing between these natural forms. Through this transformation, viewers
        observe how nature and the city might intertwine, prompting reflection on how urban environments can grow in
        harmony with the natural world.
    </p>

    <h2>Proccess</h2>


    <p>Firstly the relevant data was collected from open access databases, governmental websites, and disaster related
        organizations' websites. The data was filtered and organized in order to be more operable. Then, the sketches
        were made, in the interest of exploring the best way to represent the desired information. Various chart styles
        and numerous ways to combine them, were examined. Later, the data sets were treated algorithmically, via the
        website Raw Graphs, and converted into desired data visualization graphs. Finally, these graphs were adjusted,
        blended together and visually arranged with the pursuance of readability, via Adobe Illustrator.</p>

    <h3>Depth Detection with Kinect</h3>

    <p> We firstly used Kinect V2 2.0 and the issue we faced was, it was good at representing a large distances of
        depths, but wasnt so good at giving a detialed view of
        small
        distances. Since the height difference in each level on our model was 3mm apart, we needed a more precise
        representation. We firstly switched from Kinect V2 to Kinect Azure, which gave us a better point cloud
        representation of the height differences in our previous model (where the heigth difference is 6mm between each
        level). However, we still needed a more precise output and we needed to exclude the object in the distance such
        as
        the surface and the floor. To be able to make this we used this tutorial to create a custom depth map via using
        GLSL. This allowed us to only have the point cloud of our model, excluding the surrounding objects.</p>

    <p>Although we had a good point cloud view of our model, we still needed to represent the height difference with a
        higher contrast in the output image. To do this, we increased the contrast between the maximum and minimum
        height
        difference. Finally we were able to get a clear debth image.</p>

    <h3>Organic Growth Interaction</h3>

    <p>For the organic growth, we used the previous method of using noise and edge detection to generate a growing city
        effect. This time, the organic growth represented the city, so we decided that the generation should happen in
        square grids. Also we decided to change the interaction into hand movement that will be tracked bu mediapipe.
        The hand is tracked to draw a line and from this line, an organic city generates. We explored that Kinect camera
        can
        be used for Mediapipe as well, so we did not need an extra webcam. For the renewal and the regeneration of the
        organic city growth, we used a timer that resets the canvas at every 30 second. We integrated a mask where the
        lowest
        and higest parts of the terrain is blocked, therfore the growth wouldnt happen at those points.</p>



    <h2>Technical Details</h2>


    <p> For the model, we used 20 A3 Greyboards of 3mm thickness. Used a laser cutter to cut each level of topography,
        and finally glued them together. </p>

    <p> We hung the Kinect Azure and a Logitech webcam (we realized we did not need this later, and we can use Kinect's
        camera for Mediapipe instead) from the ceiling, using steel zip clips. We used a leveling ruler to align the
        Kinect
        perfectly. BenQ W1070 Projector, to project onto the model. </p>

    <p> We used Blender for modelling, and Touchdesigner to create the interactions and the visuals. </p>
