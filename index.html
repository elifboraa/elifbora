		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>I was born and raised in Ankara, Turkey. Since I was a child, I always had an interest in design and art.
			Painting, making clay sculptures and sketching has been a pastime for me. I finished
			my high school degree with IB diploma. I got into Architecture in Bilkent University. Towards the end of my
			architectural degree, I developed an interest in graphic design.
			As I graduated, I got into Hacettepe University’s masters degree of Graphic Design and learned about
			typography, color theory, printing, photography retouching, logo design, animation and motion graphics. I
			have increased my software skills by learning about 3D softwares. I also developed a deeper knowledge on
			Adobe Creative Suite software. I have written my thesis on the
			topic of “The Importance of Data Visualization in Urban Context and a Project on Environmental Problems in
			Ankara”. While making research for the thesis, I developed an interest in
			creative coding and data visualisation.</p>
		<p>Currently I am enrolled in MSc Creative Computing in CCI, where I am expanding my skills and knowledge about
			computational art and design. My work involves coding, artificial intelligence, and creative softwares such
			as Touchdesigner and Unity, in order to create interactive and immersive art that can respond to complex
			ideas.</p>
